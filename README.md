## Mr. Helpsworth. The AI Assistant of Yesterday's Tomorrow Today. 

# About:
Mr. Helpsworth was designed for everyone. His job? That's simple. Whatever you want him to do. Whether your kid needs a math tutor, you need a knowledgeable kitchen aid or a guidance coach, Mr. Helpsworth can help (probably).
Mr. Helpsworth is an AI-powered chatbot companion. His core responses are generated by the ChatGPT API, with user vocal inputs transcribed by OpenAI's Whisper and text-to-speech synthesis through the elevenlabs API for verbal communication. 

The retro-terminal-inspired web page was developed on the front end in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and deployed by a Flask backend server. Audio is recorded on the front end through JavaScript MediaRecorder, and the text/audio inputs are sent to the backend for processing. 

# Setup:
Before accessing the included APIs, a `.env` file containing the following keys must be added to the file structure. 
```OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXX```
```ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=XXX```
